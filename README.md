    This folder contains 3 folders each containing an index.js file with a solution to a challange.

1.Student-Grade-Generator

     This program prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The program then outputs the correct grade as follows: 

    A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.

    
2.Speed-Detector

    This program takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it prints “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function prints: "Licesnce suspended"

3.Net-Salary-Calculator

    This program calculates the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary.
    The sum of the Payee tax, NHIF payment and NSSF payment is deducted from the salary to get the net salary.

    The source for the rates is https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/taxrates.htm
